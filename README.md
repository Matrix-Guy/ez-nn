* Actual applicability of this application is likely limited, this is just meant for a fun demonstration of TensorFlow.

## Upcoming Features (higher importance closer to the top)
* Corrected license file
* Lots of commenting and documentation
* Many more neural network options
* Full users guide and documentation
* Code shortening and increased efficiency
* Cleanup confusing mix of classes and ids
* Possible stopping of TensorBoard inside the application

## Known Issues
* Folder name configuration error
* Start button showing at inappropriate times
* TensorBoard does not interact properly on windows

## Prerequisites

* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) (Recommended) or [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) for installation

* [Python ^3.6](https://www.python.org/)

## Installing and Deployment
